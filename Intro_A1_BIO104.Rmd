## Field Sampling Data Analysis and Presentation using R SoftwareBIO 104 Lab A1 Species Diversity Report

### Goals for Lab 1:

-  Import data into R
-  Save data in R as variables
-  Plot diversity data as a scatterplot and a box-plot
-  Plot certain parts of your data

#### 1. Getting Started

You will be using R for data analysis this semester. R is a versatile, free data handling
software widely-used by scientists. R is great for organizing data, analyzing data, and
presenting data.

##### Here is some basic vocabulary you will need when using R:

- R script: the lines of code that you are writing (filename.R)

- R project: your R script, any variables you have created, and your current R
environment (filename.Rproj)

- Variable: a way to store your data for use in the R script. For example, if you type x=3
into R, then R now stores x (the variable) as the number 3.
â€¢ Package: a set of functions/codes that you can load into your script (examples -
gsheet, ggplot2)

- Function: an action or calculation that you perform on your variables (examples -
gsheet2tbl, subset, mean, library)

- Comment: does not run as code, starts with #. You use comments to keep track of
what your code is doing
More information on R is at http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-beforewe-start.html#why_learn_r

##### Helpful Hints

- Uppercase/lowercase matters!

- Spaces and empty lines do not matter in your code

- Do not use spaces in your variable names or file names (use _ or - or . )

- Links to GoogleSheets need to be in 'single quotes'

- #Comment your code so you know what's going on

- Store variables using <-

- Access the data points in a variable using variable [ ]
